# Feature Demonstration

## New Features Overview

### 1. Vim-like Command Mode

**How to use:**
1. Position cursor at the beginning of an empty line
2. Press `:` to enter command mode
3. Type your command (e.g., `w`, `q`, `wq`)
4. Press Enter to execute

**Available Commands:**
```
:w or :write       → Save the current file
:q or :quit        → Quit (warns if unsaved changes)
:q! or :quit!      → Force quit without saving
:wq or :x          → Save and quit
```

**Visual Feedback:**
```
Status line shows: :wq_
Help line shows: :wq_ (Enter to execute, ESC to cancel)
```

### 2. Improved Save Function

**Before:**
- If no filename: Shows error "No filename specified"
- File never gets saved

**After:**
- If no filename: Automatically saves as "untitled.txt"
- Success/failure status returned
- Clear status message: "Saved to untitled.txt"

**Usage:**
```
Ctrl+S           → Save file (creates untitled.txt if needed)
:w               → Save file (vim style)
```

### 3. Fixed Exit Behavior

**Before:**
- Ctrl+X with unsaved changes: Shows message but doesn't track state
- Pressing Ctrl+X again: Still doesn't exit

**After:**
- First Ctrl+X: Shows warning with 3-second timeout
- Second Ctrl+X: Exits immediately
- After 3 seconds: Timeout resets, need to press twice again

**Usage:**
```
Ctrl+X           → Exit (with confirmation if unsaved)
Ctrl+X (twice)   → Force exit with unsaved changes
:q               → Quit with warning if unsaved
:q!              → Force quit without saving
:wq              → Save and quit
```

### 4. Performance Improvements

#### Before:
```
Request timing: None (could spam API)
Timeout: None (could block forever)
CPU usage: High (100 FPS)
Stuttering: Yes (especially during API calls)
```

#### After:
```
Request throttling: 1 second minimum between requests
Timeout: 3 seconds maximum per request
CPU usage: Reduced by ~50% (50 FPS)
Stuttering: Eliminated (non-blocking with timeout)
```

**Technical Details:**
- Added `last_completion_request` timestamp tracking
- Enforced 1-second minimum interval between AI requests
- Added 3-second timeout to prevent indefinite blocking
- Increased event loop delay from 10ms to 20ms

## Keyboard Reference

### Standard Controls (All work as before)

Ctrl+G           → Toggle AI on/off
```

### New Vim Commands

## Testing Results

All features have been validated:

✅ Vim commands execute correctly
✅ Save function creates default file
✅ Exit confirmation works
✅ Performance throttling active
✅ Timeout prevents blocking
✅ No security vulnerabilities
✅ Backward compatible

## Migration Notes

**No breaking changes!**

- Existing files continue to work

Users can:
